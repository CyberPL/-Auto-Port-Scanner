# Auto-Port-Scanner
Working on a bash script to make a automate port scanner via some tools like Masscan, Rustscan and Nmap. Use all these tools because of accuracy and catch as much as open ports and service running on the port for better result. After getting all open ports by using "Nmap script scan" we can find a possible vulnerability on running services on an open port.
